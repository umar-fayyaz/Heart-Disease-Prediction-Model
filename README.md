This project involved building a 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 using the 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐡𝐚𝐦 Heart Disease dataset from 𝐊𝐚𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞. The dataset was first explored for basic structure, missing values, and duplicates. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers.⁣
⁣
The dataset, initially imbalanced, was balanced using 𝐒𝐌𝐎𝐓𝐄 (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Machine learning models were then applied, beginning with 𝐋𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, which yielded an accuracy of approximately 72% on test data and 71% on training data. Cross-validation with K-Fold was performed, resulting in an average accuracy of 72%. Feature contributions were analyzed to understand their impact on the model.⁣
⁣
To further enhance the learning experience, 𝐗𝐆𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭, a powerful classification technique, was employed, achieving a notable accuracy of around 84%. Cross-validation was also conducted for XGBoost.⁣
⁣
An interactive console input function was created to allow real-time prediction of heart disease risk based on user input, making the model not only educational but also practical.⁣

Tools and libraries used include 𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐬, 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐏𝐲, 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐥𝐢𝐛, 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐧, 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐏𝐲, 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐭-𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐌𝐎𝐓𝐄.
